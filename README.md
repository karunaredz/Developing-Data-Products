Here, you find the two files ui.R and server.R corresponding to my shiny app. Try this APP in the following link:

This APP provides you a prediction for the results of the matches for Brazil soccer team during the current World Cup to 
being held in Brazil. In this APP you enter your the prediction (goals) of the Spanish team rival, and the application 
returns you a number with the prediction of the Goals for the Brazil team (may be against some soccer fans out there 
cheering for other teams). The APP uses the fact that Brazil always get three goals more than its rival. Enjoy it!
